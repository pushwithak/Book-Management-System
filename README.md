# Book-Management-System
BMS is a robust application designed to manage books and users efficiently. Built with Python3 and SQLite, the system provides role-based functionality for administrators and users. Administrators can add, delete, and search for books. Users can search for books, borrow books. The system incorporates authentication, ensuring secure login for both roles.
The BMS offers a command-line interface for interaction and uses PEP 8-compliant, maintainable code to ensure high-quality software practices.
